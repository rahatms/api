## Installation

**Note**: You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer.

- Navigate to the root directory `/api` and use the command `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- After all dependencies have been installed, use the `npm start` command to start the server (Initially the code won't start a server, it will just spawn an empty instance of `nodemon`. We will program the server during the tutorial)
